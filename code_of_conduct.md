## üåí Our Sacred Pledge

In the pursuit of fostering an open and welcoming realm, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our sacred project and our ethereal community a harassment-free experience for all seekers, regardless of age, body manifestation, visible or invisible differences, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

* Focusing on what is best for the ethereal community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome attention
